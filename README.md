## Log

Wednesday Night

- I have went around looking for various resources to help me figure out my problems. Ive decieded to take a simple todo list to populate my search history for my weather App.
  The goal is to create a search field where once we press search it will populate a history list. At the same time this generates a history list, adjacent to the history list,
  we will populate a card. In this card we will display the Weather information from my search result. I hope to find a way when we click on the history we can comense a search once again. The history will also allow us to delete search results.
